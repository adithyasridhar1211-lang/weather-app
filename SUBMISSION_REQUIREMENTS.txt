SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS - WEATHER AI APP
==========================================

PROJECT SUBMISSION METHOD: GOOGLE DRIVE LINK
============================================

This project CANNOT be submitted as:
- Expo Snack link
- GitHub repository link

REASONS FOR DRIVE SUBMISSION REQUIREMENT:
=========================================

1. SENSITIVE API KEYS AND CREDENTIALS
   - Contains hardcoded OpenWeatherMap API key (3f7363efa37c0c75405403361045f5a0)
   - Contains hardcoded OpenAI API key (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)
   - Contains Supabase credentials and configuration
   - Contains Google Services configuration (google-services.json)
   - Contains OAuth client secrets (client_secret_*.json)

2. SECURITY CONCERNS
   - API keys would be exposed in public repositories
   - Credentials could be misused if made public
   - OAuth secrets could compromise authentication security
   - Sensitive configuration files contain production keys

3. EXPO SNACK LIMITATIONS
   - Snack has file size limitations for complex projects
   - Cannot handle native Android configuration files
   - Limited support for custom native modules
   - Cannot properly simulate real device functionality
   - API keys would still be exposed in Snack's public environment

4. PROJECT COMPLEXITY
   - Multi-platform React Native application
   - Native Android build configuration
   - Complex file structure with assets and native code
   - Requires proper build environment for full functionality
   - Multiple external API integrations

5. ASSET DEPENDENCIES
   - Large collection of weather background images
   - Android-specific drawable resources
   - Native Android configuration files
   - Custom icons and splash screens

6. BUILD REQUIREMENTS
   - Requires Expo CLI for proper development
   - Needs Android Studio for native builds
   - Complex dependency management
   - Environment-specific configurations

RECOMMENDED SUBMISSION APPROACH:
================================

1. Create a ZIP file of the entire project directory
2. Upload to Google Drive with appropriate sharing permissions
3. Provide the Drive link for project access
4. Include setup instructions in the submission

ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES (IF POSSIBLE):
====================================

1. Create a sanitized version for GitHub:
   - Remove all API keys and sensitive credentials
   - Replace with placeholder values
   - Add .env.example file with required variables
   - Include detailed setup instructions

2. Create a demo version for Snack:
   - Simplified version with mock data
   - Remove native Android dependencies
   - Use placeholder API responses
   - Focus on UI/UX demonstration

CURRENT PROJECT STATUS:
======================

- Fully functional React Native application
- Real-time weather data integration
- AI-powered chatbot functionality
- 5-day weather forecast system
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Professional documentation
- Complete source code and assets

The project is ready for submission via Google Drive link as it contains all necessary files and functionality while maintaining security of sensitive credentials.
